An Ecommerce Website backend made using Java Spring Boot.
I made this project while learning backend development in Spring Boot.
It focuses on the main features of an ecommerce website like: 
-Authentication & Authorization using JWTs
-CRUD operations for categories and products
-Implementing RESTful APIs  
-Paging and Sorting
-Cart handling
-Order placement


Future Scope
-Implementing a payment gateway, 
-Operation to change password through email verification
-A dashboard for sellers to handle orders


The aim behind making this project was to understand how SpringBoot works and how it makes development easier and faster. 
I learned about the core concepts of Spring like:
 - Dependency Injection
 - Inversion Of Control
 - Aspect Oriented Programming
 - Spring Containers, MVC and annotations
 - JPA Repository/ Hibernate
 - Spring Boot fundamentals
 - Database Integration
 - Error Handling
 - RESTful APIs development
 - Spring Security
